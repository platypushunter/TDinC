# TDinC

This is a program based on my [pythonTrader](https://github.com/platypushunter/pythonTrader) application

## My Goals

My goals of the project are:
-Grasp an understanding of the C++ language
-Grasp an understanding of cross platform development
-Learn to embed python in C++ for future projects

As you can see this project is mainly a personal one, not intended for _serious_ use, however I am developing it as if it were a serious program. Practice like you play, eh?

## Form and Function of TDinC

The program will be split into a couple differeent sections
-The front end
-The back end

### Front End
Now, I'm not much of a front end guy, so don't expect any sick UIs, this will be a terminal based application. The front end will consist mainly (entirely) of a terminal based interface. 

### Back end
The back end will be the real stuff here. Consisting of all the functions and what not that will be useable. 

This will consist of some "interface" files, such as "interface.py" or "interface.cpp" which will be essentially the "library" or interface for that program. 

I will solidify the workflow for python into a few functions, and then create a c++ interface for those functions.
